The repository contains two main components:

Unity Implementation: C\# scripts for the UAV simulation, including drone motion control, distance measurement, unimodal feedback modalities (visual, auditory, haptic), and CSV logging.

Analysis Scripts: Python code for statistical analysis of the experimental data, including Friedman tests, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and generation of plots used in the Results chapter.
